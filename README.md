What Does Command Line Interface (CLI) Mean?
--------------------------------------------

Command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way.

CLI is quite different from the graphical user interface (GUI) that is presently being used in the latest operating systems.

Techopedia Explains Command Line Interface (CLI)
-------------------------------------------------

CLI is an older method for interacting with applications and operating systems and is used to perform specific tasks required by users. CLI is a text-based interface, unlike the GUI, which uses graphical options that enable the user to interact with the operating system and applications.

CLI allows a user to perform tasks by entering commands. Its working mechanism is very easy, but it is not user friendly. Users enter the specific command, press “Enter”, and then wait for a response. After receiving the command, the CLI processes it accordingly and shows the output/result on the same screen; command line interpreter is used for this purpose.

It’s very common scenario in IT field that people who are familiar with one OS have to learn/work with another OS. I do see many people, who are familiar with Linux commands, looking for their equivalent commands in Windows OS. 

Open-source Linux is a popular alternative to Microsoft Windows, and if you choose to use this low-cost or free operating system, you need to know some basic Linux commands to configure, operate, and interact with your system smoothly.

When dealing with the Linux operating system, commands are required as inputs to inform or direct a computer program to perform a specific operation. Understanding the most basic Linux commands will allow you to successfully navigate directories, manipulate files, change permissions, display information such as disk space, and more. Obtaining basic knowledge of the most common commands will help you easily execute tasks via the command line.

Command Line Interface (CLI) advantages and disadvantages
----------------------------------

The advantages of a command line interface are:

- granular control of an OS or application;
- faster management of a large number of operating systems;
- ability to store scripts to automate regular tasks; and
- basic command line interface knowledge to help with troubleshooting, such as network connection issues.
- The disadvantages of a command line interface are:

GUI is more user-friendly;

- steeper learning curve associated with memorizing commands and complex syntax/arguments; and
- different commands used in different shells.
